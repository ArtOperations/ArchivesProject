The Manifesto of Concrete Realism

February 5th, 2007 / 1h15am

1. I merely make ordinary depictions of everyday objects using a paint-brush, paints and canvas or piece of cardboard. There is a danger in things that we deem extraordinary. It leads to a kind of sensationalism or glorification of the ersatz, chosen thing as spectacle. Is a plate with a knife that has a chunk of butter left on it too ordinary to be depicted in paint? Why must we choose extraordinary objects?
2. My painting is concrete because I can explain it in concrete terms, and it is actual painting, that is, not ersatz. It is realist because it depicts scenes and objects from real everyday life. My goal is the Dutch vanitas painting.
3. The colors are subdued because in real life the colors are subdued. Most objects in real life are not made up of bright neon colors. I do at times interpret colors in my own intuitive way, the way the colors feel to me. But this feeling of color is concrete. My intuitions are concrete realities.
4. So I can paint from my imagination, this doesnâ€™t contradict the basis of concrete realism. What appears in my imagination is real to me, but the process is the same: I take my paint-brush and apply paint to the canvas. My artistic process is concrete. I apply a layer of paint after which I wait until the layer has dried before applying
another layer.
5. My paintings are historical, are a form of philosophical journalism. I make novelistic phenomenologies. That is, I portray the phenomena that occupy my mind, I depict that which I sense in the world and inside myself. The work is empirical, and therefore concrete and actual.
6. I am not necessarily painting my emotions.
