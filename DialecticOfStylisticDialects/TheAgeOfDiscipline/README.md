1. The graphomotor function has transformed itself. It has let itself be fabricated into full-blown Discipline, but not the “Discipline and Punish” kind. It is the fruit reaped from thousands of years of history. It is the History of Technical Skill becoming solid and concrete as a sort of Moving Tablature.
2. Discipline has a Number and Order. It is statistical perfection. It is the driving force, the motive force behind the Work of Art. The New Age of Discipline commences.
3. Formulation of Drives and Motivations in Tabular Form. Recreation of the exact replica of the exact simulacrum. The very virtuality of Dreamconscious Forms and Shapes driven forward by the Integrating Intentional Field. A Hard Mathematics.

4. A kind of pretext is being set up for abstract mathematical symbolism to be used in a purely random way. The Age of Discipline is the long-awaited installation of Pure Technical Knowledge. You’ve always known what to do and how to do it. Now you have the chance to prove the only truth in existence: I am right and you are wrong.
5. All human beings believe in themselves to some extent. If they had to choose themselves over you, they will choose themselves all across the line. Humans are selfish and egocentric.
6. The Age of Discipline is a new chance at an old bargain: Adaptation. Are you a fast enough thinker? Can you outphilosophize me? The Age of Discipline is a furious age of addiction to speed. It is an age of Vigilance which is beyond Fear. It is an age of destroying old mind-sets and replacing them.

7. The object refuses to be instrumentalized. It becomes splattered onto the canvas in a shred of edges, a veritable maelstrom of jagged, rugged geometric formions, the biogenetic or biotic code beginning to show its fasciae. No one is ever fully wrong. There is an incremental scale, a gradus, on which points, called nodes or notes, are scattered general meanings. The point is made, and scattered paradigmatically. The only loser is the winner; i.e. the only winner is the loser.
8. It is the strategy of the Oscillating Mind-Set, set in the grammar and phraseology of Limitless Unconditioned Reflex. We are but passengers on the Train of Vigilance.
9. To study the self-effacing Knowledge of Formions is itself Unconditioned. The only way to remand the stolen testimonial genius is to become him in self-effacing Métis-warrior status, compelled always to reconsider a peaceful alternative. The jagged edge of silence is The Color Wheel.
