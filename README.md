The Archives Project
====================

The Archives Project. The artist strives to remain current, to retain her currency, to be genuine and genuinely contemporary. A contemporary, the artist seeks to stay true to her time. The art grows old, the artist sees all things pass. Her art is an Art of Passage. She is an Artist of Passage. A Bridge-Figure lost in time. In passage.

The contemporary artist is driven to scale her art practise. Production must never cease, must run smoothly. Her art, become a full-time business, grows Lean, Agile. Operations are scaling up to industrial scale. The daily business of her industry engulfs her.

She worries about assets and liabilities. Auditing, tracking, monitoring, a web presence, teleconferencing, Unified Communications. The artist is Always-On. The artist in a time of Convergence: The Age of Discipline.

The artist cannot wait for inspiration and creativity to come to her. Minutes, hours, days are passing. She must meet the demand. She must deal with stocks & flows. She has become a multi-national corporation in scope and in scale. Her craft is the maintenance of culture, of ambient moral temperatures.

She is building a monument TO Culture, an Empire of cultural artefacts. She cannot ask for help. She must comply. Destiny never waits.
